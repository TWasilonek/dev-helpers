## Dev Helpers
A personal project that I use to explore concepts like testing, React hooks, typescript.
It is a web app with some handy helper tools that I use in daily coding, like text transformations and translations to multiple languages.

This repository contains two main sections:
* `google-functions` contains REST API handlers deployed in Google Cloud.
* `client` - contains the frontend app.

## Setup
Go the the `client` folder and follow the instructions.
